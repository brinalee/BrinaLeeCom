							<p>After crunching on some baked onion rings from Trader Joes, it's time for the new and improved BrinaLee.com.  It's a new beginning for everyone reading to accompany me on my journey and new discoveries in the fields of computer science and user experience design.</p>
							<p>Thank you for being here and wish me luck!</p>
